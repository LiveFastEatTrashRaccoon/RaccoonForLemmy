# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Raccoon for Lemmy is under active development and receives updates approximately every month. Third-party libraries
are monitored weekly for security updates and the app is kept in sync with upstream changed to address as timely as
possible any vulnerabilities.

Should you discover a security-related issue after the release of a new version, it will receive a patch release as
soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security-related issues, please report them via email at livefast.eattrash.raccoon@gmail.com.

Please refrain from posting security-related issues publicly until we have had a chance to address them.
