## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Raccoon for Lemmy (hence the "App") handles your personal
information. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data.

### Data collection and usage

#### Analytics and crash reports

The App does not collect any analytics about its usage, not even for diagnostic purpose.

#### Remote contents

Mind that the contents you create and the result of the interactions with other contents you engage
in (including but not limited to the posts you create, your reaction to other people's posts, etc.)
is sent to the remote instance you are connecting to and server administrators can access everything
in plain text.

As a consequence, server admins are responsible for the usage they make of these data and the
maintainers of the App shall bear no liability whatsoever.

Please refer to the specific privacy policy of the instance you are connecting to or contact its
administrators in case of doubts.

#### Local storage

The only kinds of data that that is stored locally on your device are:

- drafts for unpublished posts;
- application settings (not account preferences, which are saved server-side);
- the tokens or credentials used to authenticate your connection to the server.

These data are completely and permanently removed once you uninstall the App and, everything is
either saved in an encrypted key store or an encrypted database.

### Permissions

The App requires certain permissions to access device features necessary for its functionality.
These permissions may include access to the device's storage or hardware features.

However, these permissions are solely used within the App and for the purpose that is clearly made
apparent to the end user (e.g. uploading a picture as an attachment to a post).

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in our practices or legal
requirements. We will notify you about significant changes by providing a prominent notice within
the App or by other means. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically.

### Your Consent

By using th App, you consent to this privacy policy.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this privacy policy or our privacy
practices, please contact us at livefast.eattrash.raccoon@gmail.com.
