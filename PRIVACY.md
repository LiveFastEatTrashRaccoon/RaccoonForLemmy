This Privacy Policy explains how RaccoonForLemmy (hence "the App") handles your personal
information. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data.

### 1 Data Collection and Usage

#### 1.1 Non-Personal Data

The App does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or personal data during its
usage. We do not track, store, or transmit any data that can be used to identify individual users.

#### 1.2 Local Storage

All data generated or entered within the App is stored locally on your device. This includes any
files, documents, settings, or other information created or accessed through the app. We do not
upload or sync your data to any external servers or Cloud services and all the information that is
persisted is saved in an encrypted database on the device internal storage.

### 2 Permissions

#### 2.1 Device Permissions

The App requires certain permissions to access device features necessary for its functionality.
These permissions may include access to the device's storage or other relevant hardware components.
However, these permissions are solely used within the app and do not involve the collection or
transmission of data to external sources.

### 3 Data Security

#### 3.1 Encryption

To ensure the security of your data, the App employs encryption technologies to protect any
information stored on your device. This helps safeguard your data from unauthorized access or
disclosure.

#### 3.2 App Deletion

When you uninstall or delete the App from your device, all data associated with the app will be
permanently deleted from your device. We do not retain any of your data once the app is removed.

### 4 Third-Party Services

#### 4.1 External Links

The App may contain links to external websites or services. This Privacy Policy solely applies to
the App and its usage, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any
third-party websites or services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those
third-party services before providing any personal information.

### 5 Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in our practices or legal
requirements. We will notify you about significant changes by providing a prominent notice within
the app or by other means. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
